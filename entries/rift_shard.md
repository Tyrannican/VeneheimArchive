### **Notes**

Whilst intra-realm travel is trivial to those that know dimensional manipulation (portals, gateways), inter-realm travel is somewhat more difficult. In the early days travel between realms was a strictly controlled affair with defined entry and exit points which were closely monitored by designated Realm Watchers. These travel points were constructed dimensional tunnels that were never closed so beings could travel across the void. Over time, other realms generated their own means of travel (Asgardian Bifrost, Veneheim Doorways, Yelen Mirrors) but even those were managed and guarded by designated Watchers.

Rift Shards were said to be created for less “diplomatic” means of travel. These shards are rather innocuous as they are simply minerals which have an affinity for dimensional magics. On their own, they are nothing more than minerals. When exposed to the energies of a specific realm however, they can open slivers in the fabric of reality itself to create a doorway from one realm to another.

The Attunement process for these shards is what makes a fully attuned shard difficult to find. The process involves creating a tear on the surface of space itself deep enough to expose the fabrics of reality. By taking a strand from the target realm and channelling it into the shard, the stone can be attuned to open a tear into that realm. This process is not without danger though. Too deep a cut and the tear will consume the being into the void before closing forever. This can also lead to cracks in reality, allowing for void to seep into a realm.

Once an attuned shard is used, the tear to the target realm stays open only a short time. The more energy is put into the shard, the longer the tear stays open for. These shards can only be used once and when the tear is closed; another attuned shard must be used to return to the host realm.

It is rumoured that Nethalial created these shards to facilitate travel to and from Heaven during the conflict between Azalius and the Eternals but this is unconfirmed.

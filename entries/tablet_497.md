### **Notes**

~~This slab was found in the depths of the Artifact Storage Vaults. An unknown language is carved into its body that no scholar here has yet identified. When touched, the tablet emits a low volume “hum” in the mind of the bearer. This is not heard by any others present who are not also touching the tablet. More research is needed. A most fascinating find!~~

**This artifact has since been destroyed as a safety precaution.**

### **Notes**

Many of these devices have been found through the realm of Astra, however the original design came from the Xendaran race at the height of their power. A cruel device, it was designed as a tool to “process” the victims of their conquests. The souls would be gathered either via a Soul Capacitor (439865) or from the bodies of the beings themselves. The raw soul would be churned through the machinery, removing imperfections and unwanted essence, leaving only the pure soul in its place. These would then be stored for later use or used at time of processing.  The most harrowing tales are from those who still lived when entering the forge. The flesh and skeletal structure were flayed away and ground down, leaving only the raw soul in its place. The anguish of those entering the forge only fed the machinery and hastened their demise.

The malice of the Xendaran people was well-known to the other realms and this device and its legacy is still felt in Astra today. Many of these forges still exist although their numbers have dwindled since the fall of the Xendaran empire. However, those that still exist serve as a reminder of a race which had shown no remorse or care for anything other than their own goals and ambition.

### **Notes**

There are many variations of this device, so it is unknown as to where the first appeared. One can assume that it was created by the Xendaran during their conquests, however. They come in many different shapes and sizes, but one commonality is they are constructed of materials which can harness the raw power of treated and untreated souls. Their primary function is to act as a power source; used to animate and power large machinations. They were primarily utilised by the Xendaran empire to power their war machines and transportation to other worlds; however, the versatility of the soul has seen them be used in other forms throughout Astra. Certain fringe worlds have used the souls of recently deceased to power their sparse transportation networks whilst others have used them to empower their races with “magics” to further enhance their development.

Regardless of their use, souls still harbour the essence of the individual and they are fully aware of their surroundings. These devices are effectively prisons for those contained within. There are very few accounts of souls who have escaped these devices and persisted long enough to tell their tale but those that are known describe the confines of the Soul Capcitor as “deafening” and “torturous”.

### **Notes**

Not much is known about Belial’s prior history other than that he was cast into the deepest recesses of Hell alongside Lucifer during the Purge of Haven (ID: ADD). Aeons passed until a crack in Hell appeared which he used to spread discontent and whispers into the realms. When Vaelus (ID: ADD) was cast from Telua into the far reaches of Astra, Belial reached out under the guise of Akellion of Xendar (ID: ADD) whispering for him to seek out the forces of Xendar to aid in freeing him. Vaelus found his way to Xendar and convinced the Xendaran Exarch Taelax (ID: ADD) to form an invasion force which could subjugate Telua and use the planet as a celestial engine to pierce into Hell itself and free Akellion (Belial). The invasion was thwarted and Vaelus resorted to channelling the power from a Celestial Eternity Platform (ID: ADD). Vaelus was defeated but not before he channelled the power of the platform into Hell, opening the way for Belial’s escape into Astra and eventually, Telua.

Belial sought to sow discontent amongst the kingdoms and republics of Telua and deceive them all into believing Nethalial was the source. Tensions grew and war eventually was waged between Telua and Nethalial’s forces. During the confusion of war, Belial retrieved the Source (ID: ADD) from the Vaults of Eoa (ID: ADD) and called out Nethalial directly. Belial revealed his deceit blaming Nethalial for the downfall and corruption of Azaelus which led to the Eternal’s downfall and his rightful place at the side of Lucifer. He revealed the Source and shattered it to reveal the Abyssal Shard (ID: ADD) within which he plunged into the land below sealing Telua’s slow and painful destruction. Nethalial responded with a True Death for Belial, bifurcating him as he laughed.
With Telua’s forces at Nethalial’s fortress gates in Taldarim (ID: ADD), he was powerless to convince them of the greater threat which loomed, the ¬corruption and destruction of Telua with Abyssal influence. The events which followed this sealed Telua’s fate and are detailed in ID: ADD.

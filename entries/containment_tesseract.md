### **Notes**

During the Ordering, there were forces which even the Eternals knew very little about. Concerned with how these forces may affect the realms if left unchecked, they created these devices in order to contain them for further study.

These cubic devices contain a small pocket dimension in which the entity of interest is stored. This prevents any unwanted effects of the entity bleeding out into reality. As these entities may possess unknown powers, there are numerous containment protocols in place for the device to ensure accidental (or intentional) release is a difficult task.

Once an entity has been stored in the tesseract, the outer shell of the device is coated in runes of a unique cipher to which only the wielder knows. Numerous enchantment rings and further runic carvings are placed on the shell. Next, a mental assault barrier is placed to prevent the weak-minded from attempting to decipher these runes and enchantments. Finally, a configuration for the device is set and the faces scrambled which can take millennia to reconfigure back to the correct orientation. These protocols ensure that whatever is contained within cannot possibly be released without the wielding Eternal present.

Notable items contained within CTs are: Xol’Rothian relics, Abyssal Shards, a Prismatic Moxen, and a Xol’Rothian General - Zelrava, Destroyer of Realms. Some call these devices “Runic Prison Cubes”, other call them “Shlelnaddok” – A Universe in hand. Regardless of their names, these devices are crucial to maintaining the balance between the known and unknown throughout creation.
